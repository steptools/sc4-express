# SC4 EXPRESS Schema Archive

From 2000 onward, STEP Tools maintained a public CVS archive for the SC4 schemas, where 
the SC4 working groups could upload the integrated resource and application protocol EXPRESS
schema source that corresponded to various ISO documents.   This was actively used until 
around 2010, when the working groups shifted focus to publishing the SMRL.

We have converted the original CVS archive to GIT and maintain it here for reference.
