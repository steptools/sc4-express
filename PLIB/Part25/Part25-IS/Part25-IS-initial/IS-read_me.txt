This directory contains the EXPRESS schemas of the published version of ISO IS 13584-25 (.exp) and of example physical files.

Implicit version number of published versions is 1.0
 
If errors are discovered in the EXPRESS code, corrected versions will be stored in the Released-Part25-IS folder. Thus, the Released-Part25-IS folder will contain latest versions that include all the corrections done by the ISO 13584-25 team project leader to solve the errors identified in the IS version. If no errors have yet been identified, the lattest version of each file is only available in the current directory (not duplicated in the Released directory)

Technical corrigenda will gather all these corrections. Before such  publications, released schemas with the release notes are provided for convenience
