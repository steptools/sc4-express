This directory contains:

1) in the Part25-IS-initial folder, the EXPRESS schemas of the published version of ISO IS 13584-25 (.exp) and of example physical files. Implicit version number of published versions is 1.0
 
2) in the Released-Part25-IS folder, the corrected versions of the above schema or files if errors are discovered in the code after publication of the IS document or of a technical corrigendum.

They are prepared by the ISO 13584-25 team project leader to solve the errors identified in the published version. Technical corrigenda will gather all these corrections.
