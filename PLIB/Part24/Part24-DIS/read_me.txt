This directory contains six EXPRESS schema (.exp) and their release notes (_RN.txt).

The schemas are:
1) the three library integrated information models defined in ISO DIS 13584-24, and
2) the three library_delivery_file_implicit_schema each one corresponding to one
 of the above library integrated information models, more the constraints defined in 
the corresponding conformance schema (see Annexes E, I and M of ISO 13584-24 for details).
 These schema may be directly used by implementers to generate applications 
that do not support view exchange protocols. For applications that support view 
exchange protocols, the library_delivery_file_explicit_schema shall be directly 
produced by implementers, following the process defined in Annexes E, I and M of 
ISO 13584-24. 

To enable the use of automatic generation tools based on EXPRESS schemas, the above 
schemas are always maintained at the highest level of reliability.

During the ballot cycle (and the latter up-dating of the document), when an error 
is found in one of these EXPRESS schema, this error is documented in the 
corresponding release note,  together with its solution proposed by the part editor. 

This solution is also incorporated in a new release of the above schemas.

The content of the release notes defined the changes that occurred in the 
schemas since the document was circulated
