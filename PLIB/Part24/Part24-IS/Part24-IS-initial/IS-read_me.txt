This directory contains the EXPRESS schemas of the published version of ISO IS 13584-24:2003 and of the three library integrated information model it defines (.exp). It also contains five examples of physical files described in annex P of 13584-24:2003 (.spf).

Implicit version number of published versions is 1.0

Note that the initial version of the three long form are:
N606_ISO13584_f_m_iim_library_implicit_schema.exp
N65x_ISO13584_f_v_iim_library_implicit_schema.exp
N608_ISO13584_g_m_iim_library_implicit_schema.exp 

In N607_ISO13584_f_v_iim_library_implicit_schema.exp, the entity  ENTITY length_measure_with_unit was not included thus the corresponding file did not compile. This corrections was done before publishing the file both on this server and on the SC2 EXPRESS server

If errors are discovered in the EXPRESS code of files, corrected versions will be stored in the Released-Part24-IS folder. Thus, the Released-Part24-IS folder will contain latest versions that include all the corrections done by the ISO 13584-24 team project leader to solve the errors identified in the IS version. If no errors have yet been identified, the latest version of each file is only available in the current directory (not duplicated in the Released directory)

Technical corrigenda will gather all these corrections. Before such  publications, released schemas with the release notes are provided for convenience
