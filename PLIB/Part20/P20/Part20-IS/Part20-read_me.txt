This directory contains:

1) in the Part20-IS-initial folder, the EXPRESS schemas of the published version of ISO IS 13584-20:1998 (.exp). Implicit version number of published versions is 1.0
 
2) in the Released-Part20-IS folder, the corrected versions of the above schemas or files if errors are discovered in the code after publication of the IS document or of a technical corrigendum. These corrected versions supersede the published versions. Their version number is greater that 1.0. They are prepared by the ISO 13584-20 team project leader to solve the errors identified in the published version. Technical corrigenda will gather all these corrections. Before such publications, released schemas with the corresponding release notes,  are provided for convenience
