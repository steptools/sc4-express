If errors are discovered in the EXPRESS code of files, corrected versions will be stored in the Released-Part42-TC1 folder. Thus, the Released-Part24-IS folder will contain latest versions that include all the corrections done by the ISO 13584-42 team project leader to solve the errors identified in the TC1 version. If no errors have yet been identified, the latest version of each file is only available in the current directory (not duplicated in the Released directory)

Technical corrigenda will gather all these corrections. Before such  publications, released schemas with the release notes are provided for convenience

Up to now, no errors were discovered in the files. Only textual errors were discovered. They are documented in Released-Part42-TC1\P42TC1_RN.txt.
